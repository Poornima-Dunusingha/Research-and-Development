This project was done as an R&D Task for Sprint 82.

This is a Android Project that is developed to read credit card details like card number and expiry date from the camera.

Here an OCR library called Google Mobile Vision API has been used in order to read the captured data.

Yet the accuracy of the data cannot be guranteed as the read values have slight alterations from the actual details and that sometimes it doesn't read details of cards that have slight issues like the details are a bit erased or the details being embosed.
